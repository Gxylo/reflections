When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working as a team with participants who are beyond our reach, it is a good choice for work on the project.
It helps to have a backup in the cloud Github our project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It is better to pull the changes manually because there may be some unnecessary changes within
the repository Github.

Describe the Differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one INSTEAD OF another?

Forks are used to participate in improving the code from a repository that is public, if the owner authorizes changes are added.
Clones are used to use the code that is free to make modifications as required individually.
Branches are used to add different functionalities in a project to work them individually, for the fuse end and have complete project.
