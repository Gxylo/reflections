When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working as a team with participants who are beyond our reach, it is a good choice for work on the project.
It helps to have a backup in the cloud Github our project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It is better to pull the changes manually because there may be some unnecessary changes within
the repository Github.
